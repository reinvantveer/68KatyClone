1.0     INTRODUCTION

The OPALjr software package consists of graphical shell environments for
both DOS and Windows, three executable modules (EQN2JED.EXE, JED2EQN.EXE and
PAL2GAL.EXE), a set of library device files, a set of examples and this 
on-disk manual.

The example entry files contain Boolean equations and command labels which 
are written in the EQN file format.  The entry files are used by the module
EQN2JED to create JEDEC maps which contain the programming data for a
target device.  By creating your own entry files, you can use the OPAL
software package as part of a complete PLD (Programmable Logic Device)
design development system.

The OPALjr software disk is ready to run immediately on an IBM PC or 
compatible system.  The INSTALL program should be used to install the 
software on your hard disk or another floppy disk.  


OPALjr is not copy protected, so you may make working copies for all of your 
personal computer systems.  For additional copies of the software and this 
manual, or to request information regarding the full OPAL package, contact 
your local National Semiconductor sales representative.  For technical

1.1     THE OPALjr PACKAGE

OPALjr is a functional subset of the full OPAL package.  It is designed to:

a) provide free low-level entry design support for all NSC low-density PAL 
and GAL devices

b) demonstrate the syntax and capabilities of the full OPAL PLD development 
software package, including support for higher-density MAPL devices.  



1.2 HOW OPAL WORKS

The ultimate goal of any PLD software package is to create a JEDEC map of 
the PLD fuse states that can be downloaded to a device programmer.  The 
JEDEC map contains device-dependent data, such as pin assignment, the number 
of fuses per product term, the type of feedback, and so on.  

Traditional PLD software packages require that you know details of the 
device architecture before you can create a JEDEC map.  Historically, this 
was acceptable, since the complexity and density of the available 
programmable logic devices was limited.  Devices with greater complexity and 
density are more difficult to utilize effectively and efficiently.  

The current generation of PLD software packages strives to be 
device-independent;  a design can be contructed without any knowledge of the 
device targeted for the design.  The designer need not worry about the 
architecture of the target device.  They are free to concentrate on the 
design of the system. 

The Open Programmable Array Language (OPAL) software package is designed to 
take this a step further.  Instead of only providing device independence, we 
also supply tool independence.  All of the file formats supported (OPAL, 
PLA, EQN, JEDEC) are completely "open" and compatible with recognized 
software tools such as the industry-standard ESPRESSO logic minimizer.  This 
approach results in a highly modular software system which gives the 
designer visibility and control over every step of the logic design and 
implementation process.  The designer has the freedom to alter a design at 
any step of the compilation, and to utilize familiar tools. 

1.3  THE OPAL CONCEPT

The OPAL language is a high-end solution which is included only in the full 
PAL package.  This language gives the designer the choice of using state 
machine language, multi-level Boolean equations, enhanced truth table 
functions, or any combination of the three.  This gives the designer freedom 
to choose the implementation which best suits the specific design task.  

For a center platform, the logic is compiled into the industry standard 
Berkeley PLA format, which is the input format for the popular Espresso 
logic minimizer.  At this level, the logic is the most compact.  Designers 
with specific optimization techniques can incorporate those techniques into 
the software by manipulating the PLA data.  Two such tools, developed by 
National Semiconductor, are the "FITMAPL1" and "FITMAPL2" programs, which 
will take a generic PLA table and partition it into the individual arrays 
present on the MAPL1 and 2 product family.  FITMAPL1 and FITMAPL2 and the 
PLA file format are only available with the full OPAL package. 

At the lowest level, the logic can be expressed in the standard sum of 
products (SOP) format.  This format can be compiled into the JEDEC map of a 
specific PLD.  No further logic manipulation is done at this level, so 
designers who want the highest degree of control over the logic processing 
can enter designs at this level.  However, even at this level, OPAL does 
provide for automatically mapping the logic into a specific PLD via an 
automatic pin assignment option.  This feature is available in both OPAL and 
OPALjr. 


2.0  DOS GRAPHICAL SHELL (OPAL.EXE)

OPAL-DOS requires DOS version of 2.0 or above to run. OPAL-DOS is a very 
powerful graphical shell that can be utilized to perform any operation in 
PLD design provided with OPAL software.

3.6  THE WINDOWS MENU

Unlike OPAL-DOS, OPAL-WIN has the ability to open several files at once. This 
menu contains functions that are designed to manage multiple windows. 




4.0  OPALjr DESIGN MODULES

This chapter contains command line descriptions of the OPAL Jr. modules and 
utilities. 


4.1  EQN2JED  (Equations to JEDEC)

EQN2JED converts basic sum-of-products Boolean equations to a device-specific 
JEDEC file.

The JEDEC file contains all the necessary design details which can be 
downloaded to a device programmer for programming the target PLD. The JEDEC 
file is fully compatible with JEDEC standard 3B which is supported by 
industry-standard device programmers.

A variety of information is stored to the .log file. Primarily, it documents 
the final fitting of the design with a detailed description of how each pin 
was used and what label it represents. It also includes information on the 
utilization of the device resources, and a diagram (DIP or PLCC) of the device 
and the labels assigned to the exterior pins.

Enhanced support for the GAL16V8 and GAL20V8 devices is incorporated. 
Different GAL modes are evaluated automatically to fit a design into the 
device. For a design with only combinatorial outputs, it is not possible to 
use Medium-PAL mode if more than six outputs are I/Os. This is because there 
are 6 combinatorial I/Os and 2 dedicated outputs in Medium-PAL mode. Instead 
Small-PAL mode is used. However, it is possible to use Registered-PAL mode to 
get more than six combinatorial I/Os for such a design. The trade-off is that 
the clock and OE pins are not used.

EQN2JED has the ability to perform device selection. When supplied with a 
device selection file (using the -d @selfile option on the command line, or 
CHIP design @selfile in the equation file), the module will attempt to fit the 
equation file design into each of the devices listed in the selection file. 
This is available for all devices, except for the MAPL devices, which have 
their own fitter.

There are predefined selection files called:
ALL     To attempt to fit into any device,
TTL     To attempt to fit into any TTL device,
ECL     To attempt to fit into any ECL device,
CMOS    To attempt to fit into any CMOS device.

The name of any device that fits will be printed to the screen. The fitting 
status for every device will be written to the log file. Device utilization 
statistics and pin assignments will also be written to the log file for any 
device that fits.

Synopsis:
eqn2jed [options] eqnfile 

where eqnfile is the equations file. The default extension is .eqn.

Options:

-b      
Select old versions of the 16V8 and 20V8 devices. 

-c      
Enable the security fuse on the device.

-d device       
Override the device name in equation file.

-d @selfile     
If the argument following the -d flag begins with the character @, the 
remaining text is interpreted as a device selection filename, as discussed 
above. There are predefined selectors called ALL, TTL, ECL, and CMOS. The 
selfile has a default extension of .sel.

-e errfile      
Specify the error log file for error messages instead of directing them to the 
standard error stream. This is provided since neither DOS nor UNIX C-Shell 
provides a way to redirect the errors. Default extension is .err.

-f      
Turn on the automatic pin assignment switch. The JEDEC file created reflects 
the pin assignment if successful. The pin list in the original EQN file (if 
any) is no longer valid. The pin assignment is indicated by the pin out 
diagram in the log file that is created by EQN2JED. If the -f option fails to 
assign the pins, it does not mean that there is no solution. In such cases, 
the designer may have to verify if the design will fit into the PLD and then 
manually assign the pins before compiling with EQN2JED again.

-g logfile      
Specify a different name for the log file; the default extension is .log.

-j      
Select JEDEC PLCC package for chip diagram in the log file. For ECL parts, a 
24-pin Quad Cerpak is selected.

-k      
Select non-JEDEC PLCC package for chip diagram in log file. For ECL parts, a 
24-pin Quad Cerpak is selected.

-l listfile     
Specify the list file name. The list file contains a listing of the equation 
source file with all warning and error messages at the corresponding lines. 
The default extension is .lis.

-m      
Produce a full JEDEC map as output which programs every location in the 
device. Without this option, unused sections of the device are not programmed, 
which results in a smaller JEDEC map.

-n      
The old log file will be deleted. This is often desirable since the program 
appends to the log file, if it exists, and it can become quite large after a 
number of successful calls to the module.

-o outfile      
Specify the output JEDEC file name. If no -o option is specified, the input 
file name is used with the extension .jed.

-r      
Retain repeating product terms for PALs.

-s      
Shuts off diagnostic messages.

-u ues  
Specify the User Electronic Signature as ues for GAL devices in ASCII format 
(8 bits per character). If only hexadecimal characters are used, it will use a 
hexadecimal representation (4 bits per character).

-v vecfile      
Specify the input test vector file name. The vector file must conform to the 
JEDEC standard for defining vectors. The vector file is appended to the JEDEC 
file. Each individual vector is tested to ensure that vector characters are 
valid for the pins they are assigned to. This feature ensures that vectors are 
defined correctly, however, it does not perform any simulation to ensure that 
the vector has the correct output response for the given inputs. The default 
extension is .vec.

Example:
eqn2jed -f -s -dgal16v8 6_shift 

The above command invokes the EQN2JED module. The input is the EQN file called 
6_SHIFT.EQN. The output file will be 6_SHIFT.JED, by default. As specified by 
the options, pin declaration and assignment will be done automatically and no 
diagnostic messages will be displayed on the screen. Also, the device 
specified in the equation file will be overridden by the GAL16V8.


4.2  PAL2GAL

The PAL2GAL module converts a PAL JEDEC file into a GAL JEDEC file. PAL2GAL 
first checks to ensure that there is a pin-to-pin match between the PAL and a 
supported GAL before it proceeds to do the conversion.

PAL functions that are replaceable by a GAL16V8 are:

PAL10H8         PAL10L8         PAL10P8         PAL12H6     
PAL12L6         PAL12P6         PAL14H4         PAL14L4     
PAL14P4         PAL16H2         PAL16H8         PAL16L2     
PAL16L8         PAL16P2         PAL16P8         PAL16R4  
PAL16R6         PAL16R8         PAL16RP4        PAL16RP6
PAL16RP8

PAL functions that are replaceable by a GAL20V8 are:
PAL14H8         PAL14L8         PAL14P8         PAL16H6     PAL16L6        
PAL16P6         PAL18H4         PAL18L4         PAL18P4     PAL20H2        
PAL20H8         PAL20L2         PAL20L8         PAL20P2     PAL20P8        
PAL20R4         PAL20R6         PAL20R8         PAL20RP4    PAL20RP6
PAL20RP8

PAL functions that are replaceable by a GAL22V10 are:

PAL12H10        PAL12L10        PAL12P10
PAL14H8         PAL14L8         PAL14P8
PAL16H6         PAL16L6         PAL16P6
PAL18H4         PAL18L4         PAL18P4
PAL20H2         PAL20H8         PAL20L2 
PAL20L8         PAL20P2         PAL20P8
PAL20H10        PAL20L10        PAL20P10
PAL20R4         PAL20R6         PAL20R8
PAL20RP4        PAL20RP6        PAL20RP8
PAL22V10

Note that PALs with registered outputs in the above list have a dedicated OE 
for tristate control (pin 13). When the design is converted to the GAL22V10, a 
product term tristate will be used instead; this may produce some timing 
differences.

Many devices can be converted to either a GAL20V8 or a GAL22V10. The option 
ì-g device is provided to specify which device should be used, although it 
will default to the GAL20V8 if the option is not used.

Synopsis:

pal2gal [options] palfile 

where palfile is the PAL JEDEC file to be converted. The default extension is 
.jed.

Options:

-b      
Debug mode to show intermediate diagnostics. This option will show all of the 
other modules which are executed, as well as keep all intermediate files.

-d device       
Specify the PAL device name. Override the device name in PAL JEDEC file (if 
any).

-e errfile      
Specify the error log file for error messages instead of directing them to the 
standard error stream. This is provided since neither DOS nor UNIX C-Shell 
provides a way to redirect the errors.

-g device       
Specify a GAL device to convert to. This option should be used whenever 
converting to a GAL22V10.

-o galfile      
Specify the output GAL JEDEC file. If the -o option is not specified, the PAL 
JEDEC filename is used with the extension of .gjd.

-s      
Shuts off diagnostic messages.

-v      
Do not include vectors in GAL JEDEC file. If this option is not used, then any 
vectors in the PAL JEDEC file are copied into the GAL JEDEC file. The vectors 
must conform to the JEDEC standard for defining vectors. The vector file is 
appended to the GAL JEDEC file. Note that no check is done to ensure the 
correctness of the vectors.

-u ues  Specify the User Electronic Signature as ìuesî for GAL devices in 
ASCII format (8 bits per character). If only hexadecimal characters are used, 
it will use a hexadecimal representation (4 bits per character).

Example:

pal2gal -d pal12h6 gates 

This command invokes the PAL2GAL module. The input file is the PAL JEDEC file 
gates.jed. the output file will be the GAL JEDEC file with the default name 
gates.gjd. 
the device PAL12H6 specified with the -d option on the command line will 
override any device name (if any) in the PAL JEDEC file.


4.3   JED2EQN

The JED2EQN module will disassemble a JEDEC file into the corresponding basic 
Boolean equations. 

The labels used in the basic Boolean equations created by JED2EQN contain the 
pin number preceded by the type of signal. Observing the labels makes it easy 
to determine if the pin is used as a dedicated input, combinatorial or 
registered output, and whether or not the output is used as feedback into the 
device.

Synopsis:

jed2eqn [options] jedfile

where jedfile is the JEDEC file to be disassembled. The default extension is 
.jed.

It is recommended that the -d option be used to avoid potential conflicts 
between the device name and any comments which may exist in the JEDEC file. 
However, if the JEDEC file was created by EQN2JED, this option does not need 
to be specified. JED2EQN finds this device name in the JEDEC file by searching 
the header section for the strings PAL, 
GAL, or MAPL.

JED2EQN attempts to supply meaningful label names for the pins. It does this 
by examining the JEDEC file for user-supplied labels in the NOTE PINS and NOTE 
NODES statements. The format for such statements is as follows:

'NOTE' <'PINS' | 'NODES'> [<label> [ ':' <pin number>  '*'

Only pins which are used need to be supplied. Note that in a JEDEC file, any 
line beginning with N and ending with a * is a comment.

If the number of labels is equivalent to the number of pins on the device and 
none of the labels have pin numbers assigned to them, it is assumed that the 
labels have consecutive pin numbers beginning from 1.

Note that JED2EQN does not translate test vectors within the JEDEC file.

Options:

-a      
Select the alternate operator set for output: 

	! = NOT, & = AND, # = OR and $ = XOR.

-d device       
Specify the device name. This will override the device name that is in the 
JEDEC file. There is no standard defined for placing the device name in the 
JEDEC file.

-e errfile      
Specify the error log file for error messages instead of directing them to the 
standard error stream. This is provided since neither DOS nor UNIX C-Shell 
provides a way to redirect the errors. Default extension 
is .err.

-o eqnfile      
Specify the output Boolean equations file. If the -o option is not specified, 
the jedfile name is used with the extension of .eqn.

-s      
Shuts off all diagnostic messages.

Example:

jed2eqn -dpal12h6 gates 

This command invokes the JED2EQN module. The input is the JED file called 
gates.jed. The output file will default to gates.eqn. And, the device in the 
equation file will be 
PAL12H6.



5.0     DESIGN ELEMENTS IN OPALjr

In the OPAL design language, all signals must be predefined before they can be 
used. 


5.1     SIGNAL TYPES
There are five types of signals supported by OPAL:

	1.      Input
	2.      Output
	3.      Feedback
	4.      Node
	5.      Statebit(not supported by OPALjr.)

Inputs define the signals that go into a design while outputs define the 
signals that leave a design. Both inputs and outputs are unidirectional 
signals.

Feedbacks define signals that are both inputs and outputs (bidirectional). 

NODE is mainly used for the Input Logic Macro Cells (ILMC) structure of the 
GAL6001. The ILMC is provided to store a fast changing input for later use by 
the device. Therefore, the node is an input to the AND array of the device. A 
feedback is an input to the AND array, and at the same time it is also an 
output of the OR array. A register will be between the node and the input pin 
and a register can be between a feedback and the OR array.


5.2        SIGNAL EXTENSIONS

If a designer, for example, defines o1 as output of JK flip-flop he/she can 
define in the equation block 

o1 := i1 * i2 + i3.j. 

In this case the software will divide the input functions into j input and k 
input. It will also use default clock, and reset or preset. On the other hand, 
if the designer wishes to have complete control over the design he/she can use 
signal extensions to explicitly define the functions that control the 
different inputs of the JK flip-flop. 

For example:
o1.j =  defines the function to j input of the flip-flop.
o1.k =  defines the function to the k input of the flip-flop.
o1.c =  defines the function of the clock input of the  flip-flop.
o1.re = defines the function to the reset input of the  flip-flop.
o1.oe = defines the function to the tri-state control of 
	  the output.

JEDEC Map File for a Six-bit Shift Register on the PAL16R6



Behavior of the Shift Register

SR      SL          ACTION
0        0          Hold current value
0        1          Shift left
1        0          Shift right
1        1          Load from D5-D0



6.1.1       Design
The shift register example shown below has four modes of operation (hold, 
shift right, shift left, or load) controlled by two input signals (SR, SL). It 
has six registered outputs which show the current register value, and two I/O 
pins for the shift in and shift out, depending on the direction of shift. It 
also has six input pins so that a new value can be loaded into the 
register.The operation of the shift register is controlled by the input 
signals SR and SL. Table10-1 shows the behavior of the design.

6.1.2   The Basic Equation File
With these requirements in mind, the basic sum-of-products Boolean equation 
file can be written. 

The source file begins with the design header, which usually describes the 
design and its author. The header is different from comments in two ways. 
First, the header will be reproduced in the JEDEC file, whereas comments are 
ignored. Secondly, the header is any text prior to the CHIP keyword, and 
comments are denoted by either beginning with a semicolon (;) or enclosed 
within curly braces ({ and }).

NOTE:   Don't use the keyword chip in the header or comments.--
The next portion is the declaration block, which begins with the CHIP keyword, 
then the name of the design (for documentation purposes), followed by the 
device name, if any. In this case, a device has not yet been selected, so 
unknown is entered so as not to forget to specify the -d devicename option to 
EQN2JED later on. Note that the comment on this line will not be passed to the 
JEDEC file.

The declaration block specifies a required device and/or assigns labels to 
specific pins. The next portion lists the pins which are used. By including 
all of the pins, including GND and VCC, in the proper order, we can force 
signals to specific pins. In this case, not all pins were included (e.g., CLK, 
GND, and VCC), so EQN2JED treats it as a partial pin list. A partial pin list 
specifies the order in which you would like the pins to appear; this is useful 
for buses or groups of related signals, such as in this example.

The label @define is used for declaring common subexpressions. In this case, 
it would be unclear and tedious to type /sr * /s1 in every equation. Using the 
@define statement as shown, we only need to type Hold. Since the @define 
statement simply replaces the symbol with the supplied string, particular care 
should be taken with OR-terms, which have higher precedence than AND-terms.

In addition, it is possible to specify a user electronic signature (@ues) for 
GAL devices, and declare input identifiers to be latched (@ilch) or registered 
(@ireg) on the GAL6001 within the declaration section. This is discussed in 
Appendix C and shown in the included examples.

The basic equation block, which starts with the keyword EQUATIONS and 
continues through the end of the file, is where the design is described. It is 
described using standard sum-of-products notation (XOR is also valid). The 
list of operators is described in Section C.5, and is mostly self-explanatory.

Of particular note are the operators = and :=. The former describes a 
combinatorial (asynchronous) assignment, and the latter is for registered 
(synchronous with the clock) assignment. Both are used in this design. 
Registered outputs are necessary since we wish to hold the register value (q5 
- q0), and combinatorial I/O pins (for rilo and liro) are used for cascading 
since we desire an asynchronous signal.

The designer, knowing that this device would probably be programmed onto a 
small PAL device (which often have active-low outputs), decided to declare the 
outputs as active low by placing a / in front of each output equation. If the 
design were to be programmed on a device with active-high outputs, these 
symbols would not be included.

6.1.3   Creating The JEDEC Map
The EQN2JED module assembles the basic Boolean equation file, as shown above, 
and generates a JEDEC map file. The command to execute this is as follows:

eqn2jed [options] eqnfile 

The default extension of the eqnfile is .eqn. Many flags and options can also 
be included to override default values or direct the process (refer to Section 
9.4 for more details). In this example, the equation file name is 6_SHIFT.EQN. 
Since the EQN source file has no device specified, a -d option with a device 
name must be supplied on the command line. This is because the JEDEC map is 
device specific. A PAL16R6 is the target device. Pin numbers were also not 
defined in the original source file, so the -f flag must be specified to 
enable an automatic pin assignment. Since we supplied a partial pin list, the 
-f option will attempt to assign pins in the order listed. Therefore, to 
assemble this example, type in the following:

eqn2jed -f -dpal16r6 6_shift 

The output of this process is the standard JEDEC map file that has the 
extension .jed by default. It is listed above.

In addition to the JEDEC file, this process will append design documentation 
to the .log file. This file contains the pin types and labels, and it will 
document the usage of product resources. A listing file with the extension 
.lis will only be generated if specified with the -l option. It contains a 
source listing excluding comments. It will also show all warnings and error 
messages in their appropriate location.

6.2     MORE EXAMPLES IN THE EQN FILE FORMAT
In this section all examples in the distribution disk in the EQN file format 
will be briefly discussed. The user can view these files directly and 
experiment with them as suggested here. Table10-2 provides a summary of the 
examples and their illustrated features.

6.2.1     6-Bit Cascadable Shift Register
This is the best EQN format example provided with the package and should be 
understood before examining the more complex examples or designing your own 
files. This example uses both the = (combinatorial) and := (registered) 
assignments, as well as the output enable signal.This example does not have a 
device or pin numbers declared. An appropriate device for this design is the 
PAL16R6. 

To create a JEDEC map, type:

eqn2jed -f -d pal16r6 6_shift 

6.2.2     8-Bit Synchronous Cascadable Counter 
This design is an eight bit up-down counter design which can be cascaded with 
similar devices. This example illustrates combinatorial and registered 
signals, mixed signal polarities, and the XOR operator. Pin assignments have 
already been provided, but can be overridden with the -f option. Note that if 
the pin assignments are overridden, the pin polarity information will be kept 
in tact.

The device name is also specified. Specifying a device in the equation file, 
avoids having to type -d device_name for every compilation. This is useful if 
the device to be programmed is known.

This example is designed for the PAL20X8. The compiler EQN2JED can be run 
without any flags:  eqn2jed 8_count 

To force the design to be placed on another device, simply specify the -d 
option, which will override any device name in the source file:
eqn2jed -f -d pal20r8 8_count 

Executing this command will cause an error declaring that the design will not 
fit in the selected device. This is due to the fact that the design utilizes 
nine outputs, and the PAL20R8 only has eight.

6.2.3    10-Bit Synchronous Up/Down Counter 
This design is a more complex version of the 8-bit counter. It has more 
functionality, but lacks a carry out signal due to the limits of the device. 
The designer also used the mixed polarities slightly differently than the 
designer of the 8-bit counter.Since both the device and pin list have been 
specified, this design can be compiled with: eqn2jed 10_count 

6.2.4     16-Bit to 4-Bit Priority Encoder
This is a straightforward design. An encoder is a circuit that has a number of 
inputs, and encodes whichever line is high into its binary representation. A 
priority encoder also handles the case where multiple signals may be high 
simultaneously; it encodes the highest one.

The only trick in this design is the equation for Y3, the highest bit. The 
desired equation would be:

Y3 = D15 + D14 + D13 + D12 + D11 + D10 + D9 + D8 

but this would take eight product terms if programmed in that manner, so 
DeMorganís Law was applied to the equation so that it would fit into smaller 
devices. A similar decision was made with the ANY signal.

This design is compiled by:  eqn2jed 16_4_pri 

6.2.5     16-Bit to 1-Bit Multiplexer
This is the simplest included design example, implementing a 16-bit to 1-bit 
multiplexer via combinatorial logic.

To compile this design, type:  eqn2jed 16_1_mux 

6.2.6     Hexadecimal Decoder for a 7-Segment Display 
No set of examples is complete without this design for a 7-segment LED driver 
for hexadecimal inputs. This is a combinatorial design, utilizing mixed 
polarities and output enable equations.

To run this example, type: eqn2jed hex_7seg 

6.2.7     3-Bit Counter With 7-Segment Display Output
This design is a three bit up-down counter which has a set of outputs for a 
7-segment LED. This example illustrates additional complexity, combinatorial 
and registered signals, and the use of @define for common subexpressions. By 
specifying a specific device in the equation file, we also avoid having to 
type -d device_name for every compilation.

This example is designed for the GAL22V10. The compiler EQN2JED should be run 
with the -f flag to assign the pins, since the pins were left unassigned: 
eqn2jed -f 3_7seg 

To force the design to be placed on another device, simply specify the -d 
option, which will override any device name in the source file: eqn2jed -f -d 
pal20r8 3_7seg 

Executing this command will cause an error declaring that the design will not 
fit in the selected device. This is due to the fact that the design utilizes 
ten outputs, and the PAL20R8 only has eight.

6.2.8     15-Bit Up-Down Counter
This design is a 15-bit up-down counter design which uses four state bits for 
a state-machine-like design. It shows the use of JK type registers and the 
@ues directive. Since it is such a large design, the MAPL128 device, which is 
an ideal part for large state machines, was selected. Note that the pins have 
been assigned within the file, and that both the state bits and the page bits 
have been assigned to buried registers. The advantage of buried registers is 
that external pins are not wasted for unneeded signals.This example was 
compiled into the EQN file format from an original design using a state 
machine in the OPAL file format.

Since this design has been specifically written for the MAPL128, neither a 
device nor automatic pin assignment need to be specified on the command line. 
In general, if you are using a PLCC packaged device, it may be useful to 
specify the -j option to get a PLCC instead of a DIP diagram. For devices such 
as the MAPL128, which are available only in the PLCC package, the default is 
to use the PLCC diagram.

eqn2jed 15_count 
After this command has been executed, examine the log file, which will be 
named 15_COUNT.LOG in the same directory. From the information presented in 
the log file, one can see that the design utilized the deviceís external pins 
reasonably well, using seven out a possible twenty-six. However, the file also 
shows that the internal product terms were not utilized nearly as well, making 
use of only twenty-five percent of the available terms. A designer will often 
try to fit the final design to many devices, and choose the cheapest or 
fastest of those available.


7.0  FILE FORMAT DESCRIPTIONS

7.1 VEC FILE 

A VEC file is given the default extension of ".vec". It is used as an 
intermediate file for the design test vectors.  The first line in the file is 
usually "$OPAL VECTORS". Although this line is optional, the _OPAL software 
will always generate it. This line indicates that the file was translated from 
a vector block in the OPAL design language.

The second line is the $PIN statement which defines the pin labels for each 
column of the vector table that is to follow. The $PIN statement begins with 
the keyword "$PIN", followed _by a number to indicate the number of labels. 
This number is followed by a list of that many signal labels. 

The optional $BUS statements come next.  A $BUS statement is used to declare a 
related group of signals.  The $BUS statement begins with the keyword "$BUS", 
followed by the      bus label.  Following this is a number to indicate the 
number of labels in the bus, followed by a list of that many signal labels.  

After the $PIN statement (or $BUS statements, if present), there may be an 
optional VNUM statement which declares the number of test vectors in the file. 

An optional $PROBE statement can be used to re-specify the order of the 
pins/nodes or to specify extra signals to be included in the circuit file 
.PROBE statement.  If the $PROBE statement does not exist, the labels in the 
$PIN statement will be used. 

The remainder of the file is made up of the test vectors. The allowable 
characters and format of the test vectors is identical to the JEDEC Test 
Vector Format.

The VEC file format test vectors are very similar to the JEDEC test vectors 
with only one difference. This difference is that the JEDEC format requires 
that every pin on the device PIN _be included in every test vector. For 
example, there must be 20 test conditions defined within every vector for a 20 
pin device. 

The VEC file format only includes the symbols thatyou are interested in 
testing. Two special symbols can be used to repeat test vectors. The $LOOP and 
$END statements to define a section of test vectors to be repeated.





7.2 EQN FILE


The EQN file format is a simple sum-of-products equation format for describing 
Boolean logic.  It has three components

1. Header
2. Declaration block
3. Basic equation block

There are four reserved keywords that cannot be used as identifiers in an EQN 
file:

CHIP
EQUATIONS
GLOBAL
STRING


7.2.2  COMMENTS

Comments can be freely inserted anywhere in the source file.  There are two 
types of comments. 

1. begins with a semi-colon ";" and ends with the end-of-line character.
2. begins with a "{" and ends with a "}."

7.2.3  HEADER

The header is any text before the "CHIP" keyword, with the exception of 
comments.  This will be passed on to a similar header (if one is available) of 
the output file.

7.2.4  DECLARATION BLOCK

The declaration block begins with the "CHIP" keyword, followed by a chip name 
and a device name.  Following that is an optional pin list and directives.  
The declaration block ends when the EQUATIONS keyword is encountered.

<declaration> := CHIP <chip name> <device name>
[ <pin list> ]
[ <directives>]

The "CHIP" keyword indicates the end of the header (if any) and the beginning 
of the declaration block.  The chip name is a name for the design.  The device 
name is the target device for the logic design.  

An optional list of pin identifier names follows the device name.  This is 
usually a list of pin names, which can also indicate if a pin is not connected 
("NC"), power ("Vcc"), or ground ("GND").  After the physical pins, the buried 
pins (if there are any on the device, are listed.  If a specific pin number 
should be assigned to a label, it can be specified with the "=" character. 

An optional inverting operator ("/" or "!") may precede a label to indicate 
negative polarity.

If there is no pin list, or a partial pin list, or a pin list (complete or 
partial) with some of the labels having pin numbers assigned, then it is an 
error unless an automatic pin assignment feature is invoked to assign the pins 
automatically.

Note that some devices (GAL6001 and MAPL128) have buried registers, which are 
feedbacks without an external pin.  Any assigned pin numbers greater than the 
number of external pins on the device are assumed to  be buried.


7.2.5  DIRECTIVES

One or more optional directives may follow the pin list.  Directives are 
declared after the pin list and before the "EQUATIONS" keyword.  There are 
five directives being used currently.

1. STRING Defines common sub-expressions to help clarify or shorten the 
equations in the equations block.

2. @define Equivalent with STRING.  Particular care should be taken with the 
define statement.  Using OR or XOR terms in the replacement string may not 
produce the expected behavior, since @define blindly substitutes the 
replacement string for the symbol and the OR operator takes precedence over 
the AND operator.  In addition, using an inverting operator ("/" or "!") in 
front of the @define label will only invert the first symbol, not the entire 
replacement string

3. @ues Defines a user electronic signature.  

4. @ilch Declares identifiers with latched inputs.

5. @ireg Declares identifiers with registered inputs. 


7.2.6  BASIC EQUATIONS BLOCK

The basic equations block begins with the "EQUATIONS" keyword and is followed 
by one or more equations through end of file.  

The equations assign the value of an expression to a signal.   The equation 
assigns a value to the righ hand side (RHS) of the assingment operator to the 
output/feedback signal on the left hand side (LHS) of the assignment operator. 
Two different assignment operators are used: "=" for combinatorial assignment 
and "=" for registered assignment. 

The LHS of the equation consists of a signal name.  This could be followed by 
an optional signal extension or preceded by an inversion symbol ("/" or "!").  
A label that is an input only cannot appear on the LHS of the equation.

The RHS of an equation is a logical expression that evaluates to a single 
value.  The logical expression must be described using the sum-of-products 
form, but must be reduced.  The use of parentheses for grouping is not 
permitted.

8.0  APPENDIX

8.1  DEVICES SUPPORTED

The following sections list the devices which are supported by the OPAL 
package. To use these devices within a design, enter the device name exactly 
as shown below.  Shortened forms of the name can be used if there is only one 
version of that device; for example, 16R8 can be used instead of PAL16R8.  
Note that some devices have both a PAL and GAL version, so you should specify 
which device you intend.

Most GAL16V8 and GAL20V8 devices manufactured prior to March 1991 are slightly 
different than those currently manufactured by National Semiconductor.  When 
using these older devices, the EQN2JED -B switch should be used.  To determine 
the status of any old devices, contact your National representative.

8.1.2  Buried Registers
A number of devices supported by OPAL have buried registers.  Whenever an 
appropriate signal has been specified as buried and there are no pins 
available, the signal may be assigned to a buried register.  In some cases, 
such as for the page bits on the MAPL devices, the designer may wish to assign 
a signal to a specific buried register.

Each buried register has been assigned a number which can be treated as if it 
were a pin within OPAL.The buffered input registers in the MAPL2 devices are 
used only in double-buffered input mode and refers to the output of the 
D-register nearer to the external pin.

8.2  USEFUL CONVERSIONS

8.2.1  Conversion of Flip-Flops
The table below lists forms which might be found in other languages and their 
conversion into a register-independent OPAL expression.

In addition, if the register type is known and is a DE or JK register, the 
designer may want to convert a register-independent expression into its 
register-dependent form for maximal implementation efficiency.

Register Conversions

OPAL EXPRESSION     D/DE FORM         J/K FORM

s := A;             s.d  = A;          s.j = A;
			     s.ce = 1;

s := A + B*s;       s.d = A;           s.j = A;
		    s.ce = A + !B;     s.k = !(A + B);

s := A + C*!s;                         s.j = A + C;
				       s.k = !A;

s := A + B*s + C*!s;                   s.j = A + C;
				       s.k = !(A + B); 

s := A $ s;                            s.j = A;
				       s.k = A;

s := (A + B*s) $ s;                    s.j = A;
				       s.k = A + B;

s := (A + C*!s) $ s;                   s.j = A + C;
				       s.k = A;

s := (A + B*s + C*!s) $ s;             s.j = A + C;
				       s.k = A + B;

Note that the last four equations synthesize a toggle flip-flop from a D 
flip-flop, so they allow conversions from T to JK registers as well.

For the full generalization, we can say:
s := (A + B*s + C*!s) $ D*s; 
s.j = A + C; 
s.k = !(A + B)*!D + (A + B)*D; 
which reduces to:
s := A*!D + (!A*!B*D + B*!D)*s + (A + C)*!s 
s.j = A + C; 
s.k = !A*!B*!D + A*D + B*D; 

In other words, the functions SET, RESET, TOGGLE, and HOLD can be given as:

SET       = A*!D + !A*B*C*!D + !A*!B*C*D; 
RESET  = !A*!B*!C*!D + !A*B*!C*D; 
TOGGLE = !A*!B*C*!D + A*D + !A*B*C*D; 
HOLD      = !A*B*!C*!D + !A*!B*!C*D; 

And from this you can synthesize the equations for any flip-flop, with any 
polarity of inputs.


9.0    ERROR MESSAGES

There are three types of messages:

1.Error messages, which begin with the character E. These are problems which 
will cause the program to fail or will result in incorrect output.

2.Warning messages, which begin with the character W. These are messages which 
alert the designer to possible problems in the design or in operation of the 
program.

3.Information messages, which begin with the character I. These are messages 
which give the designer additional information about the processing of the 
design or operation of the program.

The four digits following the message type identifier are a unique number 
which indexes additional information in the following error list.  In 
addition, the error number should be specified in any software bug reports.

The typical user will initially create an OPAL file and use the OPAL modules 
to automatically generate the PLA, EQN, and JEDEC files. Since these files 
were generated automatically, file format errors should not occur.  This class 
of errors contain the statement, If the file was automatically generated, 
please contact your representative. If you get one of these errors, and you 
did not edit the file in any way, you should report the problem to the 
appropriate National Semiconductor representative listed at the front of the 
manual.

9.1     COMMON MESSAGES (0000-0099)

E0001: Cannot open file XXX.--
The indicated file XXX could not be opened.  If XXX is an input file to read 
from, check to see if it exists.  If it exists, you should check the file 
protection settings which allow you to access it.  If XXX is an output file to 
write to, possible problems could be a full disk drive, invalid directory path 
or file protection that will not allow file to be written to. On DOS, you 
should also check your FILES value in the system file config.sys.

E0002: Unable to allocate memory.--
The program tried to allocate memory dynamically but was unable to do so.  
This indicates either not enough memory or an internal error.  If you are 
compiling a small to moderate design or are on a machine with ample memory, 
please contact your representative listed at the front of this manual. 
Otherwise, attempt the design on a machine with more memory.

E0003: Unable to write to disk.--
An internal program file could not be written to.  The disk drive being 
written to could be full or there may be problems in closing the file.  It is 
possible that you do not have write permission to the file or directory.  On a 
floppy disk, check the write protect tab.

E0004: Invalid/unsupported device name XXX.--
XXX could be a misspelled device name or one that is not supported. Another 
possible reason is a missing library file for XXX.  You should check that XXX 
is a supported device.

E0006: Wrong library version number #.## for device XXX.--
The version number in the library file for the device XXX is wrong. See I0007 
for the expected version number.  Try recopying the library files from your 
original release diskette, particularly if the expected version number is 
higher than the incorrect library number.  If this does not correct the 
problem, contact your representative.

I0007: Expected library version number is #.## for device XXX.--
The version number in the library file for the device XXX is wrong. The wrong 
version number is printed by message E0006.

E0010: Unexpected EOF encountered in file XXX.--
An unexpected EOF is encountered while reading the file XXX.  This could be 
caused by a syntax error.  Specify the source listing option on the next 
recompilation, and examine it for more information.

E0012: Unknown option -X on command line.--
The option -X on the command line is not recognized by the program. Check the 
list of command line options for this program.

E0013: Expect an argument after -X option on command line.--
An argument is expected after the - X option on the command line. Check the 
list of command line options to see what type of argument this option 
requires.

E0014: Input file name missing in command line.--
Every program requires the input file to be specified on the command line.  
Although the extension will default to a certain extension if not specified, 
the base file name must be given.  If you did supply it, check the syntax of 
your command line against the list of command line options.

E0015: Input file already defined - XXX.--
You already specified a different input file name.  The programs cannot 
process more than one source file at a time.  If you did supply only one file 
name, check the syntax of your command line against the list of command line 
options.

E0016: All switches must be separated by a space.--
Although some programs allow you to specify a number of options with only a 
single dash (-), this program does not.  Please give each option its own dash 
and separate all options and arguments by a space.

E0018: Path name is too long.--
The complete file name (including the path) for OPL2PLA exceeds 80 characters.

E0020: The subprogram XXX did not complete 
execution.--
The subprogram XXX could not be completely executed. Either there is not 
enough memory to execute the module XXX or error(s) occurred during the 
execution of the module.  If the problem cannot be solved by examining the 
messages produced by XXX, please contact your representative.

E0021: Invalid/Unsupported "OPTION" "XXX" on command line.--
The command line specified the option OPTION with an illegal argument of XXX.  
The argument is either invalid or unsupported within the module.  You should 
also check the spelling of the argument.

E0100: Unknown internal error.--
An unknown internal error has occurred.  Do not continue to use this program 
and report the problem to your representative listed at the front of this 
document.  Please save the input files that you were using so that we may more 
accurately find your problem.


9.2     MESSAGES WHILE READING AN EQN FILE (0100-0199)

E0101: (Line ##): Chip keyword previously declared.--
The chip keyword is declared more than once.  Either delete or comment out the 
undesired line.

E0102: (Line ##): Invalid device name XXX.--
XXX could be a misspelled device name or one that is not supported. Check the 
list of supported devices, and contact your representative if you suspect a 
problem.

E0103: (Line ##): @define keyword found before chip keyword.--
All @ directives must be declared in the declaration section.  The declaration 
section is defined as the area following the chip keyword and before the 
equation keyword.

E0104: (Line ##): @define keyword found after equations keyword.--
All @ directives must be declared in the declaration section.  The declaration 
section is defined as the area following the chip keyword and before the 
equation keyword.

E0105: (Line ##): Missing chip keyword.--
The chip keyword is missing.  The chip and equation keyword are the only 
keywords that must be present in an EQN file. You may have attempted to use 
the wrong type of file as input. 

E0106: (Line ##): Missing equations keyword.--
The equation keyword is missing.  The chip and equation keyword are the only 
keywords that must be present in an EQN file.

E0107: (Line ##): Too many labels in the pin list or missing equations 
keyword.--
The number of labels is more than the number of device pins.  Another possible 
reason could be a missing equation keyword.  Check your source file and the 
pin-out diagram for the device in question.

E0108: (Line ##): Invalid character X in identifier YYY.--
An valid identifier consists of one or more alphanumeric, underscore _ or 
tilde ~ characters.  Remove the offending character.

W0109: (Line ##): 0 is an identifier, NOT logic zero (gnd).--
The keyword gnd is used to represent logic zero.  The character 0 will be 
treated like any other identifier.  If this is not the desired behavior, 
replace the 0 with gnd.

W0110: (Line ##): 1 is an identifier, NOT logic one (vcc).--
The keyword vcc is used to represent logic one.  The character 1 will be 
treated like any other identifier.  If this is not the desired behavior, 
replace the 1 with vcc.

E0111: (Line ##): Invalid dot extension XXX.--
The dot extension XXX is either not supported or misspelled.  Consult the list 
of valid dot extensions.

E0112: (Line ##): Invalid assigned pin ## for label XXX.--
The assigned pin ## for label XXX is invalid.  The label attributes do not 
match those of the assigned pin.  For example, an active-high output is 
assigned to an active-low output.

E0113: (Line ##): Incomplete or missing pin list.--
The number of labels in the pin list is less than the number of device pins or 
the pin list is completely missing.  Specify the automatic pin fitting option 
if you do not wish to assign the pins yourself.

E0114: (Line ##): Keyword XXX used as identifier.--
The keyword XXX is used as an identifier.  Either rename the symbol, or check 
the syntax of your source file.

E0115: (Line ##): @define definition must be enclosed in "s.--
The @define statement begins with the keyword @define followed by a label and 
a string enclosed in "s.  It must also be on a single line.

W0116: (Line ##):Empty @define string for label XXX.--
An empty string is defined for the label XXX.  Recheck your design to see if 
this is what you intended.

E0117: (Line ##): @define statement must end 
with a ".--
There is a missing " at the end of the defined string.  The statement must be 
on a single line.

E0118: (Line ##): Previous equation ends with XXX.  XXX is ignored.--
An unexpected end of equation was found.  Check your source file with the EQN 
file format.

E0119: (Line ##): Unexpected character X ignored.--
An unexpected character X is encountered while reading the EQN file. The 
character is ignored in an attempt to continue reading the EQN file and catch 
as many errors as possible.  If this character is in error, remove it from the 
source file, otherwise check your source file with the EQN file format.--

E0120: (Line ##): Identifier XXX is undefined.--
The identifier XXX is not defined in the declaration section.  Either you 
misspelled the identifier or forgot to declare it.

W0121: (Line ##): Only first label in "@define XXX" is inverted.--
The @define string is directly substituted for the @define label XXX. A NOT 
operator in front of a @define label inverts the first label in the @define 
string.  It does not perform the inversion of the entire @define string.  This 
is probably not the desired behavior.

E0122: (Line ##): Expecting : after :+.  :+ is ignored.--
A semicolon is expected after the string :+ is encountered.  The :+: is the 
exclusive-OR operator in the EQN format.  If you did not intend to use the XOR 
operator, check your syntax against the EQN file format.

E0123: (Line ##): Expecting = or + after :.  : is ignored.--
An = or + character is expected after a semicolon : is found. := is the 
registered assignment operator.  :+: is the exclusive-OR operator.  If you did 
not intend either of these operators, check your syntax against the EQN file 
format.

E0124: (Line ##): Mismatched braces for comments.--
A comment begins with a { and end with a }.  The ending brace } is missing.  
Edit the source file to correct the problem.

E0125: (Line ##): Invalid character X for start of comment.--
Internal error.  A ; or { character is expected for the start of a comment.  
If there is not an obvious error with your source file, please contact your 
representative.

E0126: (Line ##): UES exceeds MM ASCII (NN HEX) characters for device XXX.--
The UES string for the device XXX cannot be more than MM ASCII characters or 
more than NN HEX characters.  An ASCII character takes up 8 UES bits while a 
HEX character takes up 4 UES bits.  This limitation is device dependent.

E0127: (Line ##): Unexpected EOF encountered.--
An unexpected EOF is encountered while reading the EQN file.  This could be 
caused by a syntax error.  Please check your source file against the EQN file 
format.

E0128: (Line ##): Unassigned labels found and the "-f" option was not used.--
Only some of the labels have been assigned pin numbers in your source file.  
To assign the others, either do it manually or specify the -f option on the 
command line.

E0129: Expect a number after XXX keyword.--
A number is expected after XXX keyword which represents the number of labels 
in the list.  XXX is either @ILCH or @IREG.  Place the correct number there in 
accordance with the EQN file format.

W0130: OR/XOR operator in @define statement.--
An OR (+) or XOR (:+:) operator was used in the @define block.  The @define 
statement performs an exact substitution of the defined string for the defined 
word.  No logical grouping is implied or enforced.  The designer should be 
wary of the precedence of AND over OR and XOR after the string has been 
substituted into the equations.

E0133: Unable to select a device from file XXX.--
When the argument following the -d option begins with @, the string following 
the @ character is a file containing a list of device names to select from.  
The most likely cause of this error message is that the device selection file 
XXX is empty.

E0134: Pin assignment operator @ is not supported; use =.--
Some equations file formats allow a pin assignment which look like pinName @ 
P15, which is not supported in our format.  Please change this to pinName = 
15.

9.3     MESSAGES WHILE READING A VEC FILE (0300-0399)

E0301: Missing $VNUM number.--
A number indicating the number of vectors in the file is expected after the 
$VNUM keyword.  Either delete the optional $VNUM line or insert the correct 
number of vectors which follow.

W0302: Extra $VNUM ignored.--
More than one $VNUM encountered in the vector file.  The first one will be the 
valid number of vectors.  You should delete the incorrect line.

E0303: Missing $PIN number.--
A number indicating the number of labels in the pin list is expected after the 
$PIN keyword.  Count the number of labels and insert the correct number.  
Please see the documentation of the VEC file format.

E0304: Unknown or unsupported keyword XXX.--
The keyword XXX is either unknown or not supported.  Please see the 
documentation of the VEC file format.

E0305: file_name: Not an intermediate vector file.--
file_name is not an intermediate vector file.

E0306: Incorrect number of labels in $PIN declaration.--
The number of labels does not match the number after the $PIN keyword. Count 
the number of labels and correct the number specified after the $PIN keyword.

W0307: Vector span more than one line.--
The vector span more than one line.  This could indicate a possible error in 
the vector file.  Please consult the VEC file format description.

E0308: Illegal character X in vector.--
There is an illegal character X in the vector.  Please consult the VEC file 
format description.

E0309: Missing $PIN statement in file XXX.--
The $PIN statement is required.  Please consult the VEC file format 
description.

E0310: P field must be defined before any V fields in vector file XXX.--
Since the P field indicates the order of the test conditions in the vectors, 
it must come before any V fields which defines the vectors.  Please consult 
the VEC file format description.

E0311: Missing pin numbers in P Field of vector file XXX.--
The P field indicates the order of the test conditions in the vectors. The P 
field begins with a P followed by a list of space-separated numbers equal to 
the number of pins for the device and ends with a *.  The list of numbers in 
the P field must match the number of pins for the device.

E0312: Invalid character ? in P Field of vector file XXX.--
The P field indicates the order of the test conditions in the vectors. The P 
field begins with a P followed by a list of space-separated numbers equal to 
the number of pins for the device and ends with a *.  Only numbers are

pin_type can be input, output or feedback.  Either redefine some of your 
signals (possibly using external wiring for feedbacks), or try fitting to a 
different device.

E1427: Wrong pin assignment for label XXX (pin ##).--
The label XXX which is assigned to pin ## is assigned wrongly.  For example, 
an active-high output is assigned to an active-low output.  Usually this 
message occurs when the label XXX is assigned manually.  However, if the label 
was assigned automatically using the -f option, there is a possible internal 
error in EQN2JED.  If this is the case, it is advisable to assign the labels 
manually.  If you suspect an internal error, please contact your 
representative listed at the front of the manual.

E1428: Unable to assign pin_type label XXX.--

Please contact your representative listed at the front of this manual.

E1432: No more OE terms to disable I/O pin ## used as input only.--
There are no more output enable terms to disable an I/O pin that is used as a 
dedicated input.  This error occurs for the MAPL128 and MAPL144 only where we 
have 3 OE terms for 12 I/O pins.  You could try different assignments for the 
pins or new equations for the output enables.  If you did the pin assignment 
manually, try letting the OPAL software do it for you.

W1433: No more OE terms to disable unused I/O pin ##.--
In the MAPL128, unused I/O pins are disabled by default rather than left 
floating provided there are enough OE terms to do it.

E1434: Global XXX equation is invalid.--
The global equation of type XXX is invalid.

E1435: Label XXX (pin ##) is not an input to the AND array.--
Internal error.  The label XXX which is assigned to pin ## is not an input to 
the AND array.  Please contact your representative listed at the front of the 
manual.

E1436: Out of term_type terms for label XXX (pin ##).--
